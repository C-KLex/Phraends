Mahindra Group isn’t worried about global players like Tesla
entering India’s highly competitive electric vehicle market, its CEO and managing director Anish Shah told CNBC.
“We’ve seen tremendous competition in India over the last 20 years. So Tesla or anyone else coming in does not faze us,” Shah said on “Street Signs Asia” Tuesday. 
“At one point, Mahindra was written off when all the global majors were coming into India. Today, we continue to have the number one market share in SUVs from a revenue standpoint,” he added.
Tesla is reportedly discussing plans to enter the EV space in India, which is the world’s third-largest auto market, according to Reuters.  
CEO Elon Musk met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June and said he has plans to “make significant investments in India.”

Mahindra Group CEO discusses its EV strategy
Despite the global competition, Mahindra has “not just survived but thrived” in the Indian market, said Shah.
“We have close to a 50% market share in the light commercial vehicle segment. We continue to have 40% plus market share in farm equipment and tractors,” the CEO said, adding the company expects to perform well in the coming years.
Last week, Mahindra raised $145 million from Singapore’s state-owned investor Temasek for its electric vehicle unit at a valuation of up to 805.8 billion Indian rupees ($9.8 billion), in the latest fundraising by the Indian automaker. Temasek will take up to 3% stake in the EV unit Mahindra Electric Automobile Limited.
The company said it expects EVs to make up between 20% and 30% of its total SUV sales by 2027.
Market potential
India’s EV market “will cross sales of 10 million units by 2030, with an overall adoption rate of more than 30% across different vehicle classes,” according to a report last year by management consulting firm Arthur Little.
It noted adoption rates remained very low — currently around 2% — due to an “absence of adequate EV infrastructure.”

Given current global supply chain disruptions and the government’s policy of making India self reliant, the report added, “It is important that India creates its own indigenous solutions and a supporting domestic value chain.”
Shah highlighted that “supply chain obviously is an important part” for India’s EV market.
“We do have a research center in India that develops a fair bit of technology as well,” he said. “But the auto industry technology is global. To that extent, there is a dependence similarly with semiconductors. And we’ve seen some of the challenges in that in the last couple of years.”

1. Earnings delight
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 400 points, or 1.16%, Monday to kick off the week. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rose 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite, which was dragged down by Tesla, increased just 0.61%.

Berkshire Hathaway shares hit an all-time high Monday after the company reported second-quarter earnings over the weekend. The Omaha-based giant’s operating earnings — which encompass profits from the many businesses it owns — totaled $10.043 billion for the quarter, 6.6% higher than the same quarter a year ago. Warren Buffett’s conglomerate also reported that its massive cash hoard has grown to nearly $150 billion. Berkshire’s Class A shares rose 3.4%, while the Class B shares rose 3.6%.
3. Tesla CFO out

Tesla
announced Monday that its chief financial officer, Zach Kirkhorn, had stepped down from his role on Friday. He was replaced by chief accounting officer Vaibhav Taneja and will stay on to help with the transition, according to an SEC filing. Kirkhorn had been with the company since 2010 and had served as CFO since 2019. Shares of Tesla fell about 3% after the news, but recovered and closed a little less than 1% on the day.
4. Bank concerns

Ratings agency Moody’s cut the credit ratings of several small and mid-sized U.S. banks late Monday, the latest step in a wave of concerns about U.S. banks. It also placed major lenders Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, State Street, Truist Financial, Cullen/Frost Bankers and Northern Trust under review for a potential downgrade. Moody’s changed its outlook to negative for 11 banks, including Capital One, Citizens Financial and Fifth Third Bancorp. The agency warned that banks with certain conditions might still be susceptible to sudden market losses or lower consumer confidence in a high interest rate environment.

It might be worth taking a close look at the fine print of Zoom
’s terms of service. CNBC’s Hayden Field reported that a recent update seems to show the video platform wants to use some customer data to train its artificial intelligence models. The “service-generated data” that the company can use to train its AI does not provide an opt-out option, according to the terms. In a follow-up blog post, Zoom clarified that “for AI, we do not use audio, video or chat content for training our models without customer consent.”

What you need to know today
U.S. stocks rebound
Asia-Pacific markets were tepid on Tuesday, and didn’t track a rebound on U.S. indexes overnight. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
 on Monday posted its biggest single-day gain in nearly two months, while the S&P 500
and Nasdaq Composite
snapped four-day losing streaks as investors kicked off a week with more corporate earnings and key inflation readings. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Index
inched up 0.2%, and the CSI 300 of the largest Chinese blue chips listed in the mainland slipped 0.1%, while the Hang Seng Index
sank 1.4%.
China economic gloom
China simply cannot catch a break. Trade data showed imports tumbled an eye-popping 12.4% in July from a year ago, vastly underwhelming expectations for a 5% dip in a Reuters poll. Exports declined 14.5% in dollar terms, which was worse than the expected 12.5% drop. Any economic recovery seems a long way off.
Oracle of Omaha
Berkshire Hathaway shares rallied to record highs Monday following a strong quarterly report that showed a rebound in insurance operations as well as a massive cash hoard that swelled to nearly $150 billion. Wall Street analysts say though, Berkshire Hathaway shares are still cheap even at these record levels.
Tesla surgery
Elon Musk may need surgery. Tesla
, for sure — after seeing a second chief financial officer depart in just over four years. The automaker said Zach Kirkhorn is stepping down from the CFO role effective Friday — though he will stay through the end of the year to assist in the transition. Tesla’s chief accounting officer, Vaibhav Taneja, is its new CFO and will hold both roles concurrently.
[PRO] Goldman Sachs’ alpha picks
Microeconomic factors seem to be dominating the market action in 2023, and Goldman Sachs is offering up some opportunities to capture the greatest alpha in this environment — including one with 70% upside.
The bottom line
Is a recession actually going to happen in the U.S.?
Market watchers have been anticipating a recession in the world’s largest economy for more than a year, partly due to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive 5.25 percentage point hike in its benchmark rate in the last 16 months.
The Treasury yield curve has been inverted for more than a year now — a classic signal that a recession is looming. The disparity in interest rate payouts between short-term bonds and long-term bonds even reached its widest since 1981 in early July.
Yet, the U.S. economy has remained resilient and seemingly largely impervious to the Fed’s highest rates in more than two decades. Inflation’s also still too high and sticky.
Billionaire hedge fund investor Bill Ackman is not waiting.
He said last week he’s shorting the 30-year bill after ratings agency Fitch downgraded the U.S.’s long-term rating to AA+ from AAA. Yields neared multi-year highs recorded in October and Ackman’s projected 5.5% yield on the 30-year bill last Friday.
With inflation data in focus later this week though, some investors are likely betting that the Fed will pivot into easing mode next year — recession or not.
The bears versus the bulls.
Which thesis will end up holding out? Or is there no real playbook this time?
