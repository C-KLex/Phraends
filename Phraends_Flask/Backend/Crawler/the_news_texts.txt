Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) on-again-off-again development of a huge data center in Ireland, a project that began in 2015 and was scrapped in 2018, is set to be on again â€¦ sort of.  
A bit of history: Apple first announced the $1.9 billion plan in early 2015. It was set to be one of the largest data centers in the world, three times bigger than Apple's North Carolina facility. Court challenges followed, although Apple prevailed on many. But in 2019, the tech giant put the land up for sale, all but abandoning the project. 
However, things took a turn in July 2021. Apple discreetly filed an extension on its planning permission. Unsurprisingly, more legal challenges followed covering several issues. Currently, the case is pending and set to be examined again in October.
KEY TAKEAWAYS
Apple's Irish data center optically has a high price tag.
However, with Apple's growth, it's easy to see the positives.
A long-term bullish narrative is still there for Apple stock.
Now why would Apple go through all this trouble and expense to build a data center in Ireland? The tech giant is interested in growing its Services business abroad, which includes software, digital content, iTunes, licensing, Apple Pay, and AppleCare.
Investors surely appreciate the growth-oriented strategy. Still, they may worry about the data center's price tag. However, $2 billion is a drop in the bucket to enable strong platform growth abroad, especially for a firm flush with almost $62 billion in cash on hand.
1
In the third quarter of this fiscal year, Apple Services revenue was $17.49 billion (21.47% of total revenue). This line of business trails only the iPhone as the company's largest moneymaker. Additionally, nearly two-thirds of Apple's revenue comes from non-U.S. markets.
2
But the company clearly believes that there's room to grow or else it wouldn't bother with the Irish data center situation.
And why doubt that? Apple's Services revenue has seen consistent growth over the past few years. In fact, Services have brought in $10 billion or more each quarter since 2018.
2
That means good things for the stock.
Of course, Big Money knows all about Apple's growth and its future prospects. The Big Money has been buying up Apple stock for years, fueling a nearly 441% rise since 2017.
I follow Big Money activity and trends for a living. Institutional investors gravitate to quality time and time again. And when it comes to Apple, Big Money is a repeat customer. To see what I mean, look at the chart below. Each of those points on the chart were when my MAPsignals process ranked Apple shares with Big Money buying alongside stellar fundamentals for the company.
TradingView.com
So, despite a seemingly big price tag and ongoing legal hurdles, Apple still believes in growing its Services business abroad. Big Money sees this strategy as a strong long-term growth engine. Given the overall track record, I see little reason to doubt the thesis.
The Bottom Line
Apple is experiencing some bad luck in Ireland with its planned $2 billion data center, but global growth is still a priority. The project's price tag and legal issues pale in comparison to the possibility of further worldwide expansion. From my view, the long-term positive narrative for Apple investors is still intact.

Dow component Apple Inc. (AAPL) is trading at a six-week high ahead of Tuesday's "Apple Event," in which the tech icon will reveal the lineup of 5G-enabled iPhone 12s. A recent survey found that 53% of respondents planned to buy this year's iPhone, setting off what some analysts are calling a "supercycle" of phone upgrades. However, many could defer purchases if the release generates sticker shock like it did with the $1,000 iPhone X in 2017.
KEY TAKEAWAYS
Apple stock is gaining ground ahead of Tuesday's iPhone 12 event.
53% of survey respondents said they intend to buy the new iPhone.
The stock topped out in August and settled at 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) support in September.
Buying and selling pressure is balanced heading into the event.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives added to growing enthusiasm this week, calling the release "the most important product cycle since the iPhone 6 in 2014." He also proclaimed Apple the firm's top 5G play for the next year and is looking for starting prices to range from $699 for the smallest display to a staggering $1,099 for the iPhone Pro Max. The analyst notes that Asian suppliers are expecting "stepped-up demand" for the larger model, raising profit expectations.
Despite the table-pounding by Ives, Wall Street as a whole has grown more cautious on Apple stock due to high valuation and a rocketing share price, with a "Moderate Buy" consensus based upon 24 "Buy," 8 "Hold," and a surprising 3 "Sell" recommendations. Price targets currently range from a low of just $67 to a Street-high $150, while the stock is set to open Tuesday's session about $7 above the median $123 target. The placement raises the odds for a sell-the-news reaction after three days of higher prices.
Valuation is the analytical process of determining the current (or projected) worth of an asset or a company. There are many techniques used for doing a valuation. An analyst placing a value on a company looks at the business's management, the composition of its capital structure, the prospect of future earnings, and the market value of its assets, among other metrics.
Apple Daily Chart (2018 â€“ 2020)
TradingView.com
A multi-year uptrend topped out in the upper $50s in October 2018, giving way to a deep slide that found support at an 18-month low in January 2019. Positive price action completed a 100% retracement into the prior peak in October, yielding an immediate breakout that stalled in the lower $80s in January 2020. The stock fell more than 28 points into March, slicing through the 200-day EMA before bouncing strongly into the second quarter.
The uptick reached the January high at the end of May, setting off a fresh breakout that gathered momentum after the company announced a four-for-one split, effective on Aug. 31. The rally hit an all-time high at $137.98 just two days after the split and rolled into a correction that tested the 50-day EMA through September and into early October. The stock surged off support on Monday, with speculators taking exposure ahead of the event.
Apple Short-Term Outlook
The on-balance volume (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator topped out in 2015 and eased into a distribution phase that ended in 2016. OBV finally reached five-year resistance in August and rolled into a sideways pattern that has been crisscrossing the contested level. A breakout would finally lift this measurement to an all-time high, while a sell-the-news reaction could reinforce resistance and drop the stock into another down leg.
Long-term relative strength indicators are flashing mixed messages ahead of the event, with a weekly-scale buy cycle offset by a monthly crossover that could confirm a sell signal with a few down days. Like OBV, this combination marks an inflection point, in which buying and selling power is balanced, forcing many market watchers to sit on their hands until one side or the other takes firmer control of the ticker tape.
Relative strength is a technique used in momentum investing and identifying value stocks. It consists of investing in securities that have performed well relative to their market or benchmark.
The Bottom Line
Apple's iPhone 12 event will mark an important test of the stock's strength after shares of the tech giant topped out and rolled into a correction at the end of August.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been fined 10 million euros, the equivalent of roughly $12 million, by regulators in Italy who ruled that the company has engaged in "aggressive and misleading" sales practices regarding the water-resistant properties of its iPhones. The Italian Competition Authority, officially the AutoritÃ  Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM), levied the fine.

The AGCM found that Apple's claims about the water-resistant properties of various iPhone models, from the iPhone 8 through the iPhone 11, only held true in certain controlled lab conditions. Moreover, the AGCM criticized Apple for making bold claims about water resistance in its marketing pitch for these iPhone models while disclaiming coverage for damage caused by water or other liquids in the fine print of its warranty and refusing to repair iPhones that had suffered water damage.

Regulators in Italy have fined Apple over deceptive sales practices.
The case involves the water resistance of recent iPhone models.
Regulators found that Apple's claims only held in controlled conditions.
Meanwhile, the iPhone warranty excludes water damage.
Other fines and suits regarding water resistance may follow.
Significance for Investors
Given that Apple has total annual net sales of $274.5 billion,
5
the fine assessed by Italy's AGCM is easily absorbable by the company. However, there is a strong possibility that this will prove to be just the opening salvo in a series of regulatory and legal actions to be taken against the company in this matter by governments and consumers around the world. In that case, the potential cost to Apple could escalate rapidly.
For example, the AGCM also slapped Apple with a 10 million euro fine in 2018 over what has come to be known as "batterygate," in which Apple failed to inform consumers that its software updates were deliberately downgrading the performance of older iPhones with aging batteries.
4
After a pair of large settlements in the United States in 2020, the total worldwide cost to Apple from "batterygate" currently is trending to be upwards of $600 million.
6
Moreover, the water-resistance matter represents yet another hit to the reputation of Apple, which is bound to have some, as yet indeterminate, negative impact on future sales. Apple already has become a prime target of politicians, regulators, and consumer advocates in the wake of "batterygate."
6
The water-resistance matter is likely to provide yet more fodder for the company's critics.
Other Large European Fines for Apple
So far in 2020, French authorities have hit Apple with fines of 25 million euros (about $29.9 million) over "batterygate" and 1.1 billion euros (about $1.3 billion) over anti-competitive practices. "Apple and its two wholesalers agreed not to compete and prevent distributors from competing with each other, thereby sterilizing the wholesale market for Apple products," the president of the French Competition Authority stated in March 2020, regarding the latter case.
1
Those two Apple wholesalers were fined a combined 139 million euros (about $166.5 million) for price fixing. The collective fines assessed in this case, over 1.2 billion euros (more than $1.4 billion), were the largest ever levied in a single case, the French Competition Authority noted.
1
Looking Ahead
In the promotional materials for its recently introduced iPhone 12 models, Apple included improved water resistance among the key features.
7
In the wake of the AGCM's findings, it is possible that yet other claims made by Apple about this product's features may be met with skepticism as well, at least until they can be confirmed by rigorous independent testing. That, in turn, may put a brake on sales. Indeed, it is possible that consumers' confidence in Apple's assertions about any of its products may be damaged as well.
Additionally, the tests conducted by the AGCM stopped with the iPhone 11.
1
It remains to be seen whether the iPhone 12 measures up to Apple's claims about water resistance and, if not, whether additional fines may be forthcoming.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted everyone's plans, and Apple Inc. (AAPL) is no exception. The iPhone, Apple's signature product that revolutionized the smartphone market, saw continued sale declines as services and other products gained more traction. The sales of iPhones declined 21% to $26.4 billion from $33.4 billion during the same time period a year ago.
Apple reported quarterly revenue of $64.7 billion with quarterly earnings per diluted share of $0.73, which was above $0.69 that analysts anticipated. Apple's board of directors approved a cash dividend of $0.205 per share of the company's common stock. This quarter's results showed how the Silicon Valley giant has been navigating the geopolitical and economic uncertainties of the pandemic and how it's imagining the path forward.
"Working from kitchen tables and bedrooms, in distanced office settings and rework labs and manufacturing facilities, the team rebuilt every part of the plane while it was mid-air, and the results speak for themselves," said CEO Tim Cook describing the pressure on Apple to continue to innovate and deliver results in a remote environment. "If I had to describe our performance this quarter in a single word, it's resilient."
The delay to its iPhone 12 announcement meant that its sales were not included in the latest quarter's results. It was the first time since 2013 that Apple did not have a splashy iPhone release in September. In the last quarter, Apple continued to face supply disruptions that affected "iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch," according to Apple CFO Luca Maestri, who called it "an unprecedented period of uncertainty" and an "extremely volatile and challenging macro environment." Still, international sales made up 59% of the quarterâ€™s revenue.
With iPhone sales in decline, the spotlight was more on the services offerings through the App Store, AppleCare, Cloud Services, Music, and Apple's Payment Services. The "contactless payment has taken on a different level of adoption that I think will never go back," Cook said on the earning call, noting the United States has been "lagging" in the contactless payment segment. "I think that the pandemic may well put the U.S. on a different trajectory there. And so we are very bullish about this area and view that there are more things that Apple can do in this space."
While some of the challenges are universal to all technology and global retail companies, others are more specific to Apple's product lineup. Some analysts remain optimistic that, pandemic or not, iPhone 12 can deliver a "supercycle" for Apple investors. "It really comes down to if Apple can exceed the 231 million peak units from 2015. If they can, then this goes into the Cupertino hall of fame as a super cycle," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told CNBC.
Apple unveiled its latest iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini in a remote launch event earlier this month. Apple is hoping the 5G technology and additional innovations will stop the slump in iPhone sales. Greg Joswiak, Appleâ€™s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, called the 5G technology the "beginning of a new era for iPhone," noting other features like computational photography advancements, Super Retina XDR displays, and a new Ceramic Shield front cover.
While the company did not provide guidance for the holiday quarter, Apple remains optimistic about new iPhone sales in China, where 5G adoption is ahead, as well as the United States. "5G is a once-in-a-decade kind of opportunity. And we could not be more excited to hit the market exactly when we did," Cook told Reuters. "At least in the U.S., the carriers are being very aggressive."
