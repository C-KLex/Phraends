I define three txt files to store all the possible string output from the backend modules. 
In each file, I have defined a format of how a developer should write the output.
The following is the description of each file.

---

Link.txt:
To store the crawling link as the reference provided to the frontend. One link should spam one line.

Raw_Article.txt
To store the web articles for AI model. '---' is an end signal for each article.

Summary.txt
To store the summary for the frontend.
