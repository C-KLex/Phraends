But both sides are becoming more extreme, and the divide between so-called “bulls” and “bears” — optimistic investors who forecast rising stock prices and pessimistic investors who expect declining stock prices — is growing wider.
In a recent report, Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi, said the chasm almost resembled a political landscape, “where each side looked at the other with anger and resentment, unable to find common ground.”
But the divide makes sense when you look at the plethora of conflicting data out there. There’s the “unexpectedly feverish stock market rally in the face of leading economic indicators and bond market signals that are clearly waving a red flag,” she said.

Before the Bell: Why is there a growing division between bulls and bears?
Liz Young: The levels of investors saying that they’re bullish and investors saying that they’re bearish aren’t necessarily at extremes — but the swing and the reversal that happened in 2023 was very extreme, it’s a straight line up for bulls and a straight line down for bears. When you see that fast of a movement and that fast of a tide change, I would expect things to correct a little bit. Usually, things overshoot when people get overly optimistic or overly pessimistic, and then we try to find a settlement on some kind of middle ground.
There are relationships that aren’t working as usual out there, and you see divergences — not just the obvious ones we’ve been talking about, like AI stocks really taking off versus the rest of the market. We see stocks going up as yields go up, that relationship doesn’t make a ton of sense. Divergences like that don’t last forever, and at some point that divergence has to close. So are we seeing a lot of market froth, or does this go beyond that?
The narrow leadership of Big Tech in the market has come in a bit, you’ve seen some broadening out of the rally, which is good. But if you take a basket of AI-related stocks and then compare it to the rest of the S&P 500, the lines are moving in completely opposite directions. The spread between them has grown so big this year. That sort of thing doesn’t tend to last forever. We’re seeing inflated valuations in tech companies in the face of interest rates being held higher for longer, and in a period where the 10-year Treasury is at a level that suggests these valuations are too expensive. Valuations in general are above their 5-, 10- and 15-year averages. It seems pretty clear that we got ahead of ourselves and there needs to be some steam that comes out of this market.
I think the biggest question and the biggest debate is if and when that’s going to happen. If a rally continues, the bulls will say that the bears missed it. If it moves in the other direction, in a swift fashion, then the bears will say that the bulls were overly optimistic. It’s just gotten so divisive. It almost feels like politics. Each side looks at the other side with disdain and is so convinced that the other side is completely wrong. We have this inability to find a middle ground. So are markets diverging from the economic reality right now? I’m willing to bet that we get to a point in every economic cycle where we have a few rallies that some people don’t believe in, and we have this debate where it’s like, ‘this time is different. Everything has changed.’
I don’t think this time is different.
